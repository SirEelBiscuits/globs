GLOBS
=====

It's not a good name, I'll fix it later.

This project exists for me to get learn OpenGL programming, along side
putting to use things I've learned about C++11 and test driven
development. 

Dependencies
------------

This project has been tested with MinGW 4.8, 64 bit, but work has all
been done from cygwin. The scripts discussed in this file are all bash
scripts, and I recommend using them if possible . It should work with
the equivalent version of GCC. In theory Clang should also be able to
compile it, but I've not tested this. MSVC11 is almost certainly missing
features that are relied upon, although I've not checked, but I know it
lacks constexpr support, which I will be relying upon in future.

Libraries:
Opengl, glew, glfw, glm, devil

OpenGL should come with your os, on linux the library is usually called
libMesa, the others are available in your package manager, or at the
following websites:

http://glew.sourceforge.net/
http://www.glfw.org/
http://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.4/index.html
http://openil.sourceforge.net/

The supplied makefile is mostly fine, but the values of CXX and LDFLAGS
will probably need changing to match the program and library names on
linux.

Getting Started
---------------

After cloning this repository, I recommend you run devinstall/devinstall
to set up the hooks I've been using, and sort out directories and
submodules. After this, assuming you have all the dependencies, it
should compile.

Building
--------

This project uses make for building, but also relies on build.sh to
supply the makefile with the full list of files to work with. If no new
files have been added, building with a simple make call should be safe.

Known Issues
------------

The dependency checking I've put in the makefile fails at picking up
header changes propagations sometimes. I'll look into it one day.
